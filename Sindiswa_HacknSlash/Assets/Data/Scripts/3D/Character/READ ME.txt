To account for the possiblity of being able to have a unique character: 
There will be base character stats with its own logic and players/avatar stats that will have different set of logic.

However, there is one script that centralises the different logic that will exist for the player(s), this is to 
avoid the need for each script to reference each other everytime they need something 
from another script, instead they call on one script to do so: CharacterManager
